function soundout = AttenuateSound(soundin, att_dB)
%
% soundout = AttenuateSound(soundin, att_dB)
%
% This function attenuates the overall level of a sound of a certain number
% of decibels. The reference for the attenuation is 0-dB FS (i.e., full
% scale). The function attenuates the sound if the input number of decibels
% is negative and amplify the sound otherwise.
% If the sound is stereophonic the desired attenuation (att_dB) is imposed
% on the loudest channel.
%
% Please, note that a sinusoidal signal with peak amplitude at 1 has an
% overall level of -3.02 dB.
%
% SOUNDIN: the sound we want to attenuate
% ATT_DB: attenuation/amplification in dB
%
% DIGITAL SOUNDS HAVE A MAXIMUM DYNAMIC RANGE OF 96 dB FOR AT 16 BITS
% RESOLUTION:
% 
%       20*log10(2^16)=96.33
%
% See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBFS for further details on dB FS.
