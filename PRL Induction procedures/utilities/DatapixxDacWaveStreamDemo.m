function DatapixxDacWaveStreamDemo(wavFilename)
% DatapixxDacWaveStreamDemo([wavFilename=funk.wav])
%
% Demonstrates how to continuously stream an audio waveform to the DATAPixx DAC
% (Digital to Analog Converter) subsystem.
%
% The precision DACs are capable of updating at up to 1 MHz, and can be used to
% generate arbitrary analog waveforms with an output swing of up to +-10V.
% One application of the DACs is for the generation of precise audio stimuli.
% The audio CODECs found in typical consumer electronics have serial interfaces.
% Internally, the CODEC processes the serial data with digital interpolation
% filters, a delta-sigma modulator, and an analog reconstruction filter.
% One result is that a single dataset played back on two different CODECs
% can result in slightly different analog waveforms. Using DACs eliminates this
% variation.
%
% A second issue is the CODEC group delay. CODECs introduce a delay between
% when they receive their serial data, and when their analog outputs update.
% This delay varies from one CODEC to another, and also varies within a single
% CODEC depending on waveform update rate. Using DACs eliminates this variation.
%
% Note that the DAC outputs are not intended to drive very heavy loads. It is
% possible to drive up to +-1V waveforms (like those used in PsychPortAudio)
% directly into 32 Ohm headphones, or up to +-10V waveforms into high impedance
% (eg: 400 Ohm) headphones like those used for studio quality sound. For higher
% power, or for driving 8 Ohm speaker loads, add an external headphone amplifier.
%
% Optional argument:
%
% wavFilename = Name of a .wav sound file to load and play.
%               Otherwise the funk.wav provided with PsychToolbox is used.
