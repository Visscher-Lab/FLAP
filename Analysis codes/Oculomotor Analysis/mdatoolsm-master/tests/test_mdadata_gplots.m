%% Group plots
%
% Factors can also be used when making both statistical and conventional
% plots. In this section we will look at the basic principles that work
% similar for any group plots and additional possibilities of conventional
% plots.
% 
%% Statistical group plots
%
% With statistical plots it works the same way as with calculation of qualitative 
% statistics: instead of original variables (columns) methods use values of one 
% variable, which is split into groups according to a combination of factors specified 
% by user.
%
% The syntax for plotting methods is therefore very very similar to the
% methods for calculation of statistics: first argument is a dataset with values and second argument 
% should be a dataset with one or more factors. If data object has more than one column, 
% several subplots (up to 12) will be shown on the same figure. Here are some examples.
%
% To show how it works for histograms, let us generate a dataset, where 
% first variable will contain normally distributed 
% random values from two distributions, second variable will contain uniformly distributed
% random values from two distributions, and the third will be a factor telling
% which distribution the values come from.
%

n = 1000;
v1 = [randn(n, 1); randn(n, 1) + 2]; 
v2 = [rand(n, 1); rand(n, 1) + 0.3];
v3 = [ones(n, 1); zeros(n, 1)];

data = mdadata([v1 v2 v3]);
data.factor(3);

%%
% The grouped histogram plot for one variable can be made as following.
%

figure('Position', [0 0 800 300])
subplot(1, 2, 1)
hist(data(:, 1), data(:, 3), 'ShowNormal', 'on');

% change number of bins and add transparancy
subplot(1, 2, 2)
hist(data(:, 1), data(:, 3), 15, 'ShowNormal', 'on', 'FaceAlpha', 0.3);

% If one uses more than one quantitative variable, the method will take 
% the first and ingore the others. Since in histogram plot color is used 
% to separate the distribution of the groups, the color parameters such as, 
% for example, |'FaceColor'| should contain as many color values as many groups.

figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
hist(data, data(:, 3), 25, 'ShowNormal', 'on', 'FaceColor', 'rb');

%% 
% Now let us get back to the _People_ data and set up some factors.

load people

people.factor('Sex', {'Male', 'Female'});
people.factor('Region', {'A', 'B'});

%%
% Error bar plot for one variable is made in the same way, just use syntax and 
% parameters as usual, but second argument should be a dataset with factors.
%

figure('Position', [0 0 800 300])
subplot(1, 2, 1)
errorbar(people(:, 'Height'), people(:, {'Sex', 'Region'}), 'Type', 'std', 'Alpha', 0.1);

subplot(1, 2, 2)
errorbar(people(:, 'Height'), people(:, {'Sex', 'Region'}), 'Alpha', 0.1);

%%
% Box and whiskers plot.
%

figure('Position', [0 0 800 300])
subplot(1, 2, 1)
boxplot(people(:, 'Height'), people(:, {'Sex', 'Region'}), 'Labels', 'names');

subplot(1, 2, 2)
boxplot(people(:, 'Height'), people(:, {'Sex'}), 'Whisker', 1);

%%
% Quantile-Quantile normal plot.
%

figure('Position', [0 0 800 300])
subplot(1, 2, 1)
qqplot(people(:, 'Height'), people(:, {'Sex', 'Region'}), 'Labels', 'names');

subplot(1, 2, 2)
qqplot(people(:, 'Height'), people(:, {'Sex'}));

%% Conventional group plots 
%
% The basic conventional plots |scatter()|, |plot()| and |bar()| also can 
% work with factors and groups. However in contrast to statistical plots here
% it was decided to use separate methods in order to extend their
% functionality. The methods for group plots have a leading 'g':
% |gscatter()|, |gplot()| and |gbar()|. One can think about group plots as
% following: if a plot needs a legend, it is a group plot.
%
% The groups on these plots are separated first of all using different
% colors. Because of that color grouping is not available for group plots.
% Besides that one can change marker and line properties for each
% group. However in this case you need to specify as many values, 
% as many groups you have. Let's look at some examples.
%
% The bar plot is a specific one, the only possibility to make a group bar plot
% is to provide a dataset with several rows. While |bar()| makes separate plot
% for each row, the |gbar()| method will make a single plot with several bar series
% separated by colors as it is shown below.

% set up a data with explained variance for PCA model
expvarcal = [0.54 0.25 0.13 0.09];
expvarcv = [0.49 0.19 0.15 0.12];
data = mdadata([expvarcal; expvarcv], {'Cal', 'CV'}, {'PC1', 'PC2', 'PC3', 'PC4'},...
   {'Results', 'Components'}, 'Explained variance');

% show group bar plot
figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
gbar(data);

%%
% Parameters for the group plots are the same as for conventional
% analogues, but if one want to change color settings, separate color for
% each group has to be specified. Other properties (e.g. line style) can
% have one value (same for all groups) or also as many values as many
% groups. Here is how it works for bar plot.
%

figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
gbar(data, 'FaceColor', 'yc', 'EdgeColor', 'rb', 'Labels', 'names');

%% 
% To make a group line plot there are two possibilities. First of all it
% can work the same way as the bar plot: every row is a group.

figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
gplot(data, 'Marker', '.')


%%
% Alternatively one can provide a dataset with factors as a second argument
% for the plotting methods. In this case the rows of original data will be
% shown in groups.

data = people(:, {'Height', 'Weight', 'Wine', 'Beer'});
factors = people(:, {'Sex', 'Region'});
factors.factor('Sex', {'Male', 'Female'});
factors.factor('Region', {'A', 'B'});

figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
gplot(data, factors)

%%
% In group line plot, one can specify line and marker settings for each 
% group separately or use one value for all. It should be noticed that
% since color in group plots is used for separation of the groups, it is
% not possibile to use parameter |'Colorby'| and related.
%

figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
gplot(data, factors, 'LineStyle', {'-', '--', ':', '-.'}, 'LineWidth', 2)

%%
% Group scatter plot works similar to the normal one. To introduce groups,
% you just need to specify a dataset with factors as a second argument.
%

figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
gscatter(data(:, {'Wine', 'Beer'}), factors);

%% 
% And similar to |gplot()| one can specify color
% and marker settings: either for each group or one for all of them.

figure('Position', [0 0 400 300])
gscatter(data, factors, 'Marker', 'ssoo', 'MarkerFaceColor', 'rbrb', 'Labels', 'names')
